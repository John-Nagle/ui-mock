Notes for ui-mock

2022-06-08

Works under Linux.
Works under Wine 7.0.
Worked on Windows 10.

Still working towards a clean screen.
- Going full screen does not work under Wine. Program aborts. Wine bug. Must report.
- Can't tell if screen is maximized under Winit on Linux. Documented missing feature.

Test icon still does not have a transparent backgroupd.

TODO: Make ESC button restore menus from clean screen.
TODO: Dark mode.
TODO: Static string caching for internationalization.

Still don't have a way to build an .msi installer under Linux. Filed Rust feature request.

CF on Tracy problems.

06/15/2022
you either need tracy-client 0.13 and tracy 0.7.8 or you can patch profiling to git, which has tracy-client 0.14
oh sorry, got versions confused you need to depend on tracy-client 0.13

oh, okay. In my case going to 0.13 is not an issue at all. I just looked the most recent version on crates.io and found it to be 0.14 so I chose that one

or something
