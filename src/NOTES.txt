Notes for ui-mock

2022-06-08

Works under Linux.
Works under Wine 7.0.
Worked on Windows 10.

Still working towards a clean screen.
- Going full screen does not work under Wine. Program aborts. Wine bug. Must report.
- Can't tell if screen is maximized under Winit on Linux. Documented missing feature.

Test icon still does not have a transparent backgroupd.

TODO: Make ESC button restore menus from clean screen.
TODO: Dark mode.
TODO: Static string caching for internationalization.

Still don't have a way to build an .msi installer under Linux. Filed Rust feature request.
